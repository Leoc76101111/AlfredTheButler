# Alfred the butler
#### V1.0.1
## For users
Set up to either keep/stash, salvage or sell depending on item rarity, Greater Affix count and affix filters.
Default action is to keep unless explicitly set to sell or salvage.

Affixes are imported from wowhead, searchable on name, descript and id.
Affix settings are exportable and importable under general settings

## For devs
Alfred exposes an external collection of functions via global variable `PLUGIN_alfred_the_butler`.
Also in the task folder, there is an `external-template.lua` as a sample on how to call alfred from other plugins.
